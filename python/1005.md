# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, rina"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, Universe!"
print(a[10])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
- Looping Through a String

``` python
for x in "technology":
  print(x)
```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Hello, Universe!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))


```

QUIZ:tell me how many char appear in "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"

``` python
a = "hahdfbdjfgnbigj hatrdujemfn"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# 26 letters + 1 space
```
- Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword `in`.
- keyword `in` vs `if`
- True or False
``` python
txt = "i love you to the moon and back HSHSHSHAAGAGAGAGAH  "
# print("love" in txt) == > True
# print("HSHSHS" in txt) == > True
print("HGHSHS" in txt)  # False
```

``` python
txt = "i love you to the moon and back HSHSHSHAAGAGAGAGAH  "
if "HAAGAGA" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HAAGAGA' is present.")
```

``` python
```
- Negative Indexing
``` python
b = "Hello, rinrenss!"
print(b[-3:-2])
# -2 not included
```
- Python - Modify Strings
- The `upper()` method returns the string in upper case:
- The lower() method returns the string in lower case
``` python
```
- Remove Whitespace with `strip()` method
- The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end
``` python
b = " Hello, rinrenss! "
print(b.strip())
```
- The `replace()`method replaces a string with another string
- `seperator`
``` python
b = " Hello, rinrenss! "
print(b.replace("r", "m"))
```

```python
b = " Hello, rinrenss! "
print(b.split(","))
```

```python
b = " Hello, rinrenss! "
print(b.split("i"))
```

- String Concatenation:To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the `+` operator.
```python
a = "Hello"
b = " , "
c = "RINRenss"
d = a + b + c
print(d)
```

- Python - Format - Strings
```python
age = 18
txt = "My name is RINRenss, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))
```


```python
quantity = 2
itemno = 450
price = 12.95
myorder = "I want {2} pieces of item {0} for {1} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```
- String Methods

```python
txt = "hello, and welcome to my life."

x = txt.capitalize()

print (x)
```


```python
txt = "Hello, And Welcome to my life!"

x = txt.casefold()

print(x)
```
